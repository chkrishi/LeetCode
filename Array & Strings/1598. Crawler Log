There was another soln with stack implementation, very much similar to this.
Wasn't able to crack it.


class Solution(object):
    def minOperations(self, logs):
        counter = 0
        for x in logs:
            if x == '../':
                if counter <= 0:
                    counter = 0
                else :
                    counter -=1
            elif x =='./':
                pass
            else :
                counter +=1
        print(counter)
        if counter <= 0:
            counter = 0
        return counter
