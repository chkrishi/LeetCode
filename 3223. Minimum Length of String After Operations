#Accepted Solution
#Counter counts all the occurances of all elements in a list
#if the occurance is greater than or equal to 3 and (it is even) then add 2 to res; 
#if the occurance is greater than or equal to 3 and (it is odd) then add 1 to res;
#if the occurance is less than 3 add to the value to res and return.
